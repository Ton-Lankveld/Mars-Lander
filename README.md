Game to experiment with SVG and JavaScript

## Scope
I want to find a way to manipulate elements and groups in a screen filling SVG drawing, without frameworks or libraries.
With the exception of jQuery.

## SVG Drawings
The drawings are made with Inkscape, because; it's free, opensource, easy to lern and has an inbuild XML editor.

## Note
This is an experment in progress.
The JavaScript code is just rudementery tested, just to see if the functions do wat they suppost to do, an can break if you experiment with it.
