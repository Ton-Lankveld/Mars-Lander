Game to experiment with SVG and JavaScript

## Scope
I want to find a way to manipulate elements and groups in a screen filling SVG drawing, without frameworks or libraries.
With the exception of jQuery.

## Code Status
Most of the JavaScript functions are tested en work, but te connecting (glue) code is not compleet, yet.

## SVG Drawings
The drawings are made with Inkscape. Because; it's free, opensource, easy to learn and has an build-in XML editor.

## Note
This is an experment in progress.
The JavaScript code is just rudementary tested, just to see if the functions do wat they suppost to do, an can break if you experiment with it.
